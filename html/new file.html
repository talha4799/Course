<i>My model for business is The Beatles.<br> They were four
guys who kept each other's kind of negative tenden-
cies in check.<br> They balanced each other and the total
was greater than the sum of the parts. That's how I see
business:<br> great things in business are never done by
one person,<br> they're done by a team of people.</i>
